I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars

I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But, it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
I can't feel the way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage, anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
